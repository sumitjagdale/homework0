Hello Everyone,
Myself Sumit J,I am from India and this is my second smester at NCTU.
Since last semester I was looking for this course but it was not there at NCTU(English Version Course).
Fortunately this semester its available at NTHU and it will be a great experience to work under Professor Sun Min.

My research area is related to camera calibration and I need to have some basic knowledge of computer vision, soI believe this course will 
help me to scale up my knowledge in those field.

Based on programming homeworks I will learn alot about vision processing and estimation.
Thank you!
